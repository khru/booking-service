```Gherkin
Feature: View canceled insured bookings

  As a staff member,
  I want to list all the canceled insured bookings
  So that I can easily view the financial impact of these bookings.

    And the booking has been cancel
    When I request to view the canceled insured bookings

```

**Important questions**:
- Who would be that staff member? (would be somebody from outside the company or not)
- What's the value we want to achive with this?
- Could on a first iteration be enough with the listing without the premium price?


**Definition of Done**
Given some cancelled insured bookings, when someone ask for them, then list them all.


## Assumptions
1. Since the only thing that is required is that there be a 200 so that the clients know that the message has arrived, I have decided not to do the exercise with a framework that manages the responses.
2. Since we only have 1 client, I am not going to add the Booking dependency of knowing different time zones, even though it would be one of the first points to attack in the following implementations.
3. Currency would be EUR for now
4. I could have created 2 more classes
    * FlexibleInsured (this could contain a price and the booking)
    * Price -> in JVM an implementation of the JSR 354 â€“ "Currency and Money")
5. Because I only had time to tackle the first user story I've only created one use case this could change latter easy
6. I've use mocks and did not worry too much about the DTO to send information because I've been doing exploratory testing on the use case and this gave me the opportunity to change my mind several times, that's why by looking at the commits It could be difficult to follow my train of thoughts.
7. I could have separated the process of securing from the creation of the booking in two use cases since the creation of the booking does not have to be the process of securing, but not having the domain entities and the first user story would not have allowed us to do this , I have decided that the booking is created in the same use case, this assumption has been taken by the issue of the remaining time to invest
